# secufaku
This is sample project needed for security course to "connect web service to database".

## Why it suits alignment purpose
It connects to postgresSQL database with basic authentication.
On this web server you can make gateway with nginx 
It would be better if you do it in docker network without so web app would not have access to internet, and it would be true gateway. 
But easier is to send requests to localhost:8000 from nginx.

## How to start web app
It would be much easier with docker. Just run `docker compose up` (or `docker-compose up` if you have older version).
Server will start on `http://localhost:8000`, and it will be also available from network. If you want to disable it 
just modify `Dockerfile` in last row from `0.0.0.0:8000` to `localhost:8000`, and rebuild containers if you started them already `docker compose up --build`


## How to log in admin panel
`localhost:8000/admin` - authentication page

You need to enter the container and create user (you can see how to do this on screenshot)


### Also, you can install manually
```
pip install poetry
poetry install
# start database
# modify src/secufaku/settings.py and set user, password for database
python src/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## Configuration
You are recommended to modify `docker-compose.yml` environment variables for database and in python block too.


### Notice
Since I was in hurry and were not in mood to fix static files in docker. Please don't judge me for that ðŸ˜….
You can do this if you want. Just make pull request!
